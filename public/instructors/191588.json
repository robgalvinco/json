Whether he’s teaching new skills to his 1.5 million YouTube subscribers or collaborating with brands like Adobe, Sony, or GrubHub, his passion and enthusiasm shine through. Aaron honed his Photoshop skills in 2008, when he set a goal to capture and edit a conceptual self-portrait every day for a year.
