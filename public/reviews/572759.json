This program dives deep into detail without managing the viewers understanding of key elements before the deep dive. I felt lost at points and overwhelmed with examples and information. Using a health / medical example is very specific and makes it difficult for the viewer to related to some of the searches / keywords, etc. Using an example like clothing, shoes, etc. would be more relatable than strep-throat / medications. Lastly, there should be a clear indexing of common topics / words / and tools. There are too many tools thrown at you from the beginning with most of the tools requiring payment before use. This limits a viewers ability to follow along live with their own examples. Overall, I was excited for this course but feel more confused after the fact. My recommendation is to divide this course into beginner, intermediate, and advanced trainings. Mix up the trainers and find a better space to record (there is clear background noise and the audio is poor at times). I'm going to take more courses on learn. from Fiverr but may move back to Udemy or go right to SEMrush Academy. Thanks for taking the first step.
