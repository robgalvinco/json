Great for people who are pretty much beginners in photography. This has inspired me a lot to help my art be more interesting instead of just basic photos of my digital art or the drawing itself. VERY helpful if you know nothing about lighting. I loved how you taught that you can edit photos in Lightroom to be straight even if they're not! That's encouraging as a beginner in case you aren't perfect in your shots. You learn so much in a short time. I bought and took the course today. Thank you for this!
