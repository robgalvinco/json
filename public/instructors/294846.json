{"id":294846,"first_name":"Oliver ","last_name":"Randorff","bio":"Oliver has been animating for more than 8 years - exploring stop motion, character animation, explainer videos and title sequences. He has always been fascinated by making things move while telling a conveying story. Animation has to be convincing to the eye, leading to the study of the proper use of physics as well as animation principles. His philosophy is that teaching how to create a certain animation isn’t good enough, it’s all about knowing why and when you should use certain principles and techniques. With a passion for teaching, he has taught thousands of students about animation and After Effects through multiple platforms.","created_at":"2020-03-21T22:58:15.859Z","user_id":4957289,"title":"Freelance motion designer from Denmark with more than 8 years of experience in the field.","slug":"oliver-randorff","avatar_url":"https://import.cdn.thinkific.com/114242/ZVYoNu8RuiThWS7E0kXn_Untitled%20design%20-%202020-03-21T185916.170.jpg","email":""}
