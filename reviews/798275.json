I had previously purchased another course taught by Dan and it was fun. I like Dan's approach to teaching since he actually keeps my attention and engages you enough to prevent boredom. I came into this course understanding a little bit of HTML and little to no CSS, at least in regards to its syntax. After taking this course I have a much deeper understanding of both and my confidence with being able to manipulate CSS code is definitely higher. Now I can freely break a web site or 2 without having to worry on how to fix it.","course_id":798275,"rating":5,"user_id":24311295,"approved":true,"created_at":"2020-08-31T18:57:25.394Z"},{"id":411624,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":798275,"rating":5,"user_id":24347280,"approved":true,"created_at":"2020-09-17T11:46:57.059Z"},{"id":424205,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":798275,"rating":4,"user_id":13593417,"approved":true,"created_at":"2020-09-25T14:34:56.375Z"},{"id":428134,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":798275,"rating":5,"user_id":29492239,"approved":true,"created_at":"2020-09-28T13:21:38.664Z"},{"id":428383,"title":null,"review_text":"Dan is a true gem.
