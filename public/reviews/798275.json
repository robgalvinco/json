I had previously purchased another course taught by Dan and it was fun. I like Dan's approach to teaching since he actually keeps my attention and engages you enough to prevent boredom. I came into this course understanding a little bit of HTML and little to no CSS, at least in regards to its syntax. After taking this course I have a much deeper understanding of both and my confidence with being able to manipulate CSS code is definitely higher.
