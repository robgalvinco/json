I started in VoiceOver in 2015 with a reputable company and I felt as though I received good training. Then I began to realize that I didn't know much about all the technical aspects of this business and it became very stressful and frustrating because nobody wanted to help me unless I was willing to spend big money to learn from them and they only taught a few things and recommended that I go find answers needed through google or youtube. I don't want to bad mouth the company that I got my start from because I feel that it would be disrespectful and there were some people that I worked with there that were great people to work with. I just didn't get all of the training that I now see that I should have gotten to be better prepared as a voice artist. This session with Keith has made me feel like I made the right decision to become a voice artist and I plan to keep working with Keith if he will have me because I can truly say that I now feel more empowered to step out and give myself and this business more of an opportunity to grow and help those that are coming to Fiverr to help them with their projects. I also plan to continue to work with Keith on building my skills and knowledge about VoiceOver and Fiverr. Sadly to say, I've learned more with Keith in this session than I learned in the 10-month program I was in with the other company.

Keith helped me pinpoint where I needed to go next in starting my own VO business. The only issue I had was how outrageous his advice was on audio tech gear like #$1000 mics for beginners vs., say, a $50 mic to begin with. Very extreme. Also, there are many brands of mics out there beyond what Kieth uses, so don't believe it is all you can use to sound good!  It's just his preference. \r\nI feel there needs to be an intermediate or audio -related VO course for those interseted in acting, like for audio drama and such. Keith covers more business-related vid ads and such. Ok but limiting. Hope other VO courses are offered in time on Fiver. Kieth was great emphasizing putting in time and practice, and he is realistic despite sounding like he reads from a motivational script. For the price, it is worth it.

So, here goes.\r\n\r\nIf you are as new as I am, you may be waffling between your best course of action after getting your Fiverr account set up. I had my gigs recorded, edited, and ready to post before I took course. Then I was faced with the question of whether or not these courses were just an attempt to get new people to spend money in an attempt to feel legitimized with a badge on their profile.\r\n\r\n**NOTE TO THOSE FEELING THE SAME WAY** - If the cost is deterring you, please go and take the FREE \"Online Freelancing Essentials\" course. I learned some helpful tips, and, as of writing this, at the end you are provided with a 20% off coupon for your next course. Every dollar helps!\r\n\r\nAfter completion of the course, I can happily report that I found myself very engaged. Many of the tips are things I learned on Youtube and from other resources. However, I especially appreciated seeing the examples of recording and editing as well as the demos that Keith had put together. (Heads up, all the reviews about the sound mixing being all over the place are totally legit. Lower your volume before he plays his demos.) The prompts to create goals and a schedule were a really nice reminder too. And I'll definitely be practicing the warmup suggestions.\r\n\r\nI think you will get what you put into this course. If you are excited to learn and think the added benefit of a badge on your profile may help you start your VO business, go for it! If you think you have all the tools necessary after doing independent research, I think you will be just fine. \r\n\r\nBest of luck and cheers to all!","course_id":453127,"rating":5,"user_id":145340089,"approved":false,"created_at":"2023-02-13T20:10:44.645Z","username":"Kevin Casoria"},{"id":1181627,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":453127,"rating":5,"user_id":155684003,"approved":false,"created_at":"2023-02-15T20:24:59.496Z","username":"carolinetom ."},{"id":1184082,"title":null,"review_text":"I loved this course!

Towards the end you get information that will help you more with fiverr, but the beginning videos are all things I learned for free on youtube. I spent the money for this class because I believe (and it is reiterated towards the end of the video) that to make money on fiverr, you have to spend some money on fiverr. Only time will tell if that is an accurate assumption. The videos are not normalized overall, I was having to adjust my volume multiple times because some would be very loud while others were a bit quieter. I often felt like I was being talked to like I was 5 years old. I'm not sure about the CC it was frustrating to find a lot of inaccuracies in it. In my experience with creating CC on videos, you can adjust the type, but maybe that is not correct for all videos. It probably depends on the video editor you are using or perhaps the website autogenerates in real time. Keith talks about creating \"buyer requests\" to help make money on fiverr, but he does not explain what this is or how to do it. Maybe it is something no longer available on fiverr. I will check the forum to see if there is something there. I think this education was created in 2018. It is now 2023, I think an update would be appropriate. He shows us how he edits a read in which he removes all breaths. There seems to be plenty of debate about whether or not a VO should do that. And every client of course will be different. However, with the age of AI, I think breaths make you seem more real and credible. And I even heard somewhere that AI creators are trying to insert breaths to make it sound more real. Only time will tell if the money I spent here will be worth it. As mentioned earlier, I learned all the VO stuff for free on YouTube previously, but it does make it convenient for all the information to be compact into one spot especially if you are brand new to VO. Then, you can make notes of things you need to learn more about and search for those specific needs. Keith also goes over some helpful information about being new on fiverr later in the education video.","course_id":453127,"rating":5,"user_id":183132581,"approved":false,"created_at":"2023-12-28T13:15:17.557Z","username":"Sherri LeeAnne Hendren"},{"id":1461366,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":453127,"rating":5,"user_id":15209869,"approved":false,"created_at":"2024-01-03T18:54:45.772Z","username":"Cristina Madalina Dan"},{"id":1463166,"title":null,"review_text":"tIPS AND METHODS SEEM RELEVENT.
