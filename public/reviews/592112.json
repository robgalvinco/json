You need to get through mountains and hours of the same information over and over and over and over again just to get to those tiny bits of actually relevant learning new information. Even at double speed I felt like my brain was dying a bit by the time I got to the third section. I had to skip through the additional sections and apply logic based on personal experience and the first couple of repetitions to complete the course and I got 11 answers out of 12 right because I personally don’t use hot keys as often, and in the quizzes in between 100%, but at least I guess I paid for the badge to shop up on my profile and the downloadable action. Like I said, I did learn some information, but it was buried under “let’s do this entire process again and see if anything different comes up that can be missed if you blink”… I’m sorry, I don’t like to leave negative reviews ever, but this was on another level. I think there were six (!!) repetitions of the same process and even the subjects of the sections were the same so one couldn’t even figure out what that detailed little specific difference of information is supposed to be. I’m pretty sure this entire course could have been summarised into 1. What is it? 2. How to install action and basic tools 3. High frequency 4. Low frequency 5. Dodge and Burn 6. Finishing details and typical scenarios 7. How to apply this to Fiverr and completion. Instead there were more than 20 sections of watching the instructor um and ahh about hyper specific decisions over and over again, leaving us to make our own conclusion, as if I was watching a live stream of animals labelled “nature documentary”, instead of actually summarising. And the fact that at the end to specify it for Fiverr all he said was “look at what others are doing and good luck”. I mean, come on. It’a good that there is the option to take the course but I’m also glad it’s over.
