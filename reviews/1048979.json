I loved the way you structured the ideas.  I enjoyed the quiz feature, it helped me to realize that I was not just hearing the words but actually listening and absorbing the information.  The information was clear and concise.  I had the misconception that if I hired a ghostwriter it would be cheating as it would no longer be my work.  I see now that this is not true.  Thank you for the help,  I think that this will be a course that I can refer back to again and again.\r\n","course_id":1048979,"rating":5,"user_id":38174889,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-02-03T00:14:31.508Z"},{"id":559993,"title":null,"review_text":"Billy is very clear and encouraging. I would definitely recommend the course to first-time writers (I am one!).\r\n\r\nCouple of things to improve: properly name the downloadable files (indicating what the file content is, rather than ATTACHMENT 1, ATTACHMENT 2...) so that it's easy to identify what's in them by looking at the link. Related to this, add the downloadable files in the chapter that they belong too, rather than all together at the beginning without really explaining whether we need to read them at the start or what. It's a bit messy.\r\n\r\nIt also seemed to me that there was a plug for a Fiverr gig in every single chapter. Some of them were actually relevant, such as recommendations on editing or proofreading, but some others seemed absolutely out of the blue. Way too salesy at times. Understood if this was a free video, but it's a paid course and I don't want irrelevant ads prompting me to buy stuff on fiverr in every chapter.\r\n\r\nWith those aside. I overall enjoyed the course and it gave me a few tips to move forward with my writing.","course_id":1048979,"rating":4,"user_id":38336162,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-02-03T14:28:44.278Z"},{"id":568956,"title":null,"review_text":"Good tips on the steps to write a book\r\n\r\n\r\n","course_id":1048979,"rating":4,"user_id":38226527,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-02-12T21:51:38.243Z"}]
