{"id":153183,"first_name":"Kirk","last_name":"Nelson","bio":"Design has always been a big part Kirk's life. He's the guy who gets more excited about the title card in a movie than the actual plot. He has a bachelor’s degree from George Mason University and an Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) certificate in Photoshop. His works have been published more than 400 times, and he has more than 20 years of experience. One of his primary goals as an instructor is to inspire artists to learn and grow. He wants to see his students gain skills, knowledge, and techniques that they didn’t have when they came to his class. It brings him great joy to awaken a love of design in students and see them learn, grow, and explore on their own. \r\n|\r\nshortsummary: Graphic artist and Adobe Certified Specialist with 20+ years of experience in branding and design.
