He must have overused it and in combination with Video School Online's microphones, it's just exhausting to listen. He should let this asian guy Sam talk more. What I miss are recordings of the actual deployment process which is fairly easy on YouTube due fewer resolution restrictions like on other platforms, where 1280 x 720px quality is often mandatory.","course_id":1059017,"rating":3,"user_id":9498902,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-03-07T05:57:05.918Z","username":"Anna Stoermer"},{"id":609608,"title":null,"review_text":"Awesome!

Very well done!!!\r\n\r\nDo you guys do YouTube channel revisions? (Example: Going to my channel and maybe advise an improvement on a certain area) If you offer that service I am more than willing purchase your services.\r\n\r\nAlso, the price for this course is very affordable and that is a big plus.
