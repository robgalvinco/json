Related to this, add the downloadable files in the chapter that they belong too, rather than all together at the beginning without really explaining whether we need to read them at the start or what. It's a bit messy.\r\n\r\nIt also seemed to me that there was a plug for a Fiverr gig in every single chapter.

I saw this course advertised to me, and Fiverr promised me a badge if I took it, so I was like, \"Hey, why not? I might learn a thing or two.\"\r\n\r\nMy first issue right off the bat with the course is that Billy McIntyre does not speak to the correct audience. He doesn't speak to a Fiverr ghostwriter, explaining the process of ghostwriting for clients. He speaks to a client that is seeking to publish a book. This means there are times he says things like, \"Check out Fiverr to find the right ghostwriter for you.\" As a Fiverr ghostwriter myself, this was not directly connected to me as I wished.\r\n\r\nMy second issue was that he goes over very generic tips. He doesn't walk you through writing tips or how to ghostwrite (which I found odd since he's a professional ghostwriter). Instead, he provides basic tips that most writers have probably already known like \"Try Grammarly,\" and \"Use an outline.\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the information wasn't bad, and I do appreciate the books he showed at the end of the course, as they are all very highly rated and worth a read, but it wasn't what I was hoping for in the course. The course subtitle says \"Learn how to write a book...\" but I don't think I learned any valuable writing advice. I did learn a few things about marketing, but that's about it. I wish the course was directed more towards Fiverr sellers like myself that want to sharpen their ghostwriting skills. If that's what you're expecting, it's probably not the course for you.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to hate on the course. There were a few things I found helpful. It's just a deceiving title that disappointed me. I guess the course is worth the $40 though. At least you get a badge on your account.
