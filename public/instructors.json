Regardless of the size of the project he's working on, he's passionate about getting into the nitty-gritty with letterforms. His interest was born when he became an avid analyzer of typography. He took a deeper interest than a lot of his fellow students at the time, and this was reflected in his work. The more he pushed himself, the more he realized his limitations and the greater need for creating letters from scratch. Throughout his design career, he's spent thousands of hours studying and creating letters. Nicolas enjoys helping other passionate people learn. He's glad to be a resource to help students become experienced hand letterers at a fast pace. He believes that hand lettering is an essential tool for all designers, and therefore, a tool that everyone should know how to use. Your client pays you to solve a problem, or to create a solution for them. Justice can't always be served by laying the company's name out in a trendy font.

In 2015, his close friend Phil Ebiner asked him to collaborate on a Photography Masterclass for the online education platform, Udemy.  They now have many courses in multiple languages on several online platforms and have over a million students from around the globe.  Sam continues to collaborate with this online community daily and enjoys creating and updating courses.  \r\n\r\nOutside his work, Sam enjoys photography as a sort of meditation, a way to slow down and focus on a single frame.  Between his travels abroad and love of being outdoors, he has focused on landscape and street photography.  He has left photography for himself, rarely working professionally as a photographer and for this reason, is excited to be offering his photos as prints, the way in which he believes photography should be appreciated.\r\n\r\n|\r\nshortsummary:Expert filmmaker, photographer and educator with 10+ years experience ranging from commercials and music videos to feature films and social media campaigns.
