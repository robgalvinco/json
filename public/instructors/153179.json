{"id":153179,"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Fredrickson","bio":"Nicolas spends his days hand lettering for both large and small brands, from Fortune 500 companies to local coffee shops. Regardless of the size of the project he's working on, he's passionate about getting into the nitty-gritty with letterforms. His interest was born when he became an avid analyzer of typography. He took a deeper interest than a lot of his fellow students at the time, and this was reflected in his work. The more he pushed himself, the more he realized his limitations and the greater need for creating letters from scratch. Throughout his design career, he's spent thousands of hours studying and creating letters. Nicolas enjoys helping other passionate people learn. He's glad to be a resource to help students become experienced hand letterers at a fast pace. He believes that hand lettering is an essential tool for all designers, and therefore, a tool that everyone should know how to use. Your client pays you to solve a problem, or to create a solution for them. Justice can't always be served by laying the company's name out in a trendy font. Design is more than that, and hand lettering is the first place to start.\r\n|\r\nshortsummary:Passionate hand letterer with experience working with a myriad of brands from small startups to Fortune 500 companies.
