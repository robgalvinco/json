I started in VoiceOver in 2015 with a reputable company and I felt as though I received good training. Then I began to realize that I didn't know much about all the technical aspects of this business and it became very stressful and frustrating because nobody wanted to help me unless I was willing to spend big money to learn from them and they only taught a few things and recommended that I go find answers needed through google or youtube. I don't want to bad mouth the company that I got my start from because I feel that it would be disrespectful and there were some people that I worked with there that were great people to work with. I just didn't get all of the training that I now see that I should have gotten to be better prepared as a voice artist. This session with Keith has made me feel like I made the right decision to become a voice artist and I plan to keep working with Keith if he will have me because I can truly say that I now feel more empowered to step out and give myself and this business more of an opportunity to grow and help those that are coming to Fiverr to help them with their projects. I also plan to continue to work with Keith on building my skills and knowledge about VoiceOver and Fiverr. Sadly to say, I've learned more with Keith in this session than I learned in the 10-month program I was in with the other company.

Keith helped me pinpoint where I needed to go next in starting my own VO business. The only issue I had was how outrageous his advice was on audio tech gear like #$1000 mics for beginners vs., say, a $50 mic to begin with. Very extreme. Also, there are many brands of mics out there beyond what Kieth uses, so don't believe it is all you can use to sound good!  It's just his preference. \r\nI feel there needs to be an intermediate or audio -related VO course for those interseted in acting, like for audio drama and such. Keith covers more business-related vid ads and such. Ok but limiting. Hope other VO courses are offered in time on Fiver. Kieth was great emphasizing putting in time and practice, and he is realistic despite sounding like he reads from a motivational script. For the price, it is worth it.

The course also provides great resources to practice and to keep your voice healthy. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to become a voice over artist and to those who already perform as voice actors/actresses.

Keith gives a lot of useful tools to make great performances. I was already doing a little bit of VoiceOver before this course but I do realize now there was a lot of things that I didn't know. You might think by taking this course that some of the topics are useless, but the truth is that everything is useful! Even the part when he tells you how to be organized!\r\n\r\nAs I'm producing my own songs for more than a year, I already know a lot about how to treat vocals but I think it would be good to add a little section with some advices on how to get a personal plug-in-sauce to get this powerful high end saturated TV and Radio advertisement, or how to use a de-esser and other stuff...\r\n\r\nIn any case, I recommend you to do this course and watch it from the very beginning till the very end!\r\n\r\nThanks Keith!","course_id":453127,"rating":5,"user_id":46839577,"approved":true,"created_at":"2022-01-06T14:01:09.472Z","username":"Giovanni BERNABE"}]
