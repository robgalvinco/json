His explanation of design fundamentals (elements and principles of design) were fairly strong and concise. That said, I don't necessarily feel that he is the best instructor on this topic. The guided sections in Illustrator were not strong at all and had a lot of \"dead air\", unnecessary repetition (no/bad video editing where complete phrases were repeated multiple times), slow pacing, and lack of intimate knowledge of Adobe Illustrator (e.g. no mention of the shape builder tool!). For students that have a strong understanding of the elements and principles of design, or students who are highly versed in Adobe Illustrator, this course may not be very useful for you.
