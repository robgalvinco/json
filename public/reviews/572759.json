This program dives deep into detail without managing the viewers understanding of key elements before the deep dive. I felt lost at points and overwhelmed with examples and information. Using a health / medical example is very specific and makes it difficult for the viewer to related to some of the searches / keywords, etc. Using an example like clothing, shoes, etc. would be more relatable than strep-throat / medications. Lastly, there should be a clear indexing of common topics / words / and tools. There are too many tools thrown at you from the beginning with most of the tools requiring payment before use. This limits a viewers ability to follow along live with their own examples. Overall, I was excited for this course but feel more confused after the fact. My recommendation is to divide this course into beginner, intermediate, and advanced trainings. Mix up the trainers and find a better space to record (there is clear background noise and the audio is poor at times). I'm going to take more courses on learn. from Fiverr but may move back to Udemy or go right to SEMrush Academy. Thanks for taking the first step.

I cannot stand watching presenters who have a poor stage presence, talk fast, or have an unpleasant voice. The presenter spoke clearly, spoke slowly, had great intonation, and was pleasant to watch/listen for a few hours. He did a good job. I particularly appreciate all the insight on SEO tools. This was solid. I also thought the final section on Project Management and the \"tips\" were exceptionally done. Really great in-depth PM insight. This was all flawlessly executed in my opinion. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a good course - but I think what kept it from being a \"GREAT\" course was that it did not meet my expectations. This course is titled \"SEO Fundamentals: The Ultimate Framework\" which made me think this was going to be an SEO 101 course. It's not. The presenter talked about redirects, XVF, anchor texts, slugs, indexing, operators, linking root domains, wireframing, indexable URLS etc flippantly, but he doesn't explain what that is. Now I personally know what those terms mean because I've been doing this for years and know enough about SEO already to be dangerous. I'm doing this to \"prove\" my knowledge on my Fiverr profile. But if someone is truly a beginner and ignorant, they might think this is the training course for them, and I am not sure that it is. I think a beginner would get really lost and have to stop/pause and google/research terms to wrap their heads around what is being talked about. Perhaps this minor problem could be addressed by providing a supplementary documentation of \"course terms and definitions\" so that those who are truly beginner have a frame of reference for the what is being discussed. Also, minor issue, but the quizzes were strange. The questions asked did not seem to be the most pertinent ones, in that they were based on the \"tools\" being discussed, and not on conceptual knowledge. Additionally, in one of the quizzes, I was asked about the tool for \"wireframing\" before the presenter had even discussed wireframing, so it was \"out of order\". Lastly, this course was (in my opinion) too \"high level\" to truly be called/considered an \"Ultimate Framework\". When I as a user/buyer/learner see \"Ultimate Framework\" I'm thinking \"Great! Everything I need to know all in one place.\" This did not deliver that because it was very high level. There was not a lot of deep dive. In fact, I would say that the only nitty gritty \"how to\" stuff was when he showed us how to navigate the tools, but in time, these tools interface will change and hence this insight will become outmoded. Also, he talks a lot about how to figure out what is wrong, (which is great) but does not go into deep detail on how to fix it or what to do about it. Possibly because there is not step-by-step methodology to problem solving SEO concerns? But still, I would have appreciated some more insight, even if it was a case study or at least one example with details or an instruction sheet to start taking action once an issue has been discovered. \r\n\r\nI do not regret taking it, and like I said, I know enough about SEO to be dangerous, but I think from a marketing perspective, if you are going to title this as \"SEO Fundamentals: The Ultimate Framework\" you are setting up an expectation that does not deliver. A more accurate title for this would be something more along the lines of \"SEO Overview: Beyond the Basics\". Again - really good! Not great. Only reason why it wasn't great is because the title gave me an \"expectation\" and the course doesn't deliver on that expectation. Still, it's a good course! Def helped me finesse my knowledge.
