It says 'Launch, Market And Monetize A Podcast', but when you go through Sam here course it says 'Starting A Podcast On A Budget'. These things are not the same. \r\n\r\nI also found that this course is really North America based. As a user in Europe and producing a podcast in a different language, a great part of this course becomes irrelevant. \r\n\r\n","course_id":604154,"rating":3,"user_id":49763001,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-07-19T06:27:31.444Z","username":"kevinayrton ."},{"id":725198,"title":null,"review_text":"Great course!
