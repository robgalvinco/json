Unlike normal websites which are just coded with HTML5, CSS3, a JavaScript framework like jQuery, and PHP, browser crawlers need to dig through all the installation folders, subfolders like wp-content, and templates like single.php, functions.php, or simple page templates. \r\nJust because WordPress is an easy-to-use CMS, it doesn't mean it's good for SEO. To repeat me, the larger the website installation filesize sum, the worse your ranking might be and the poorer your website's performance as well.","course_id":923384,"rating":4,"user_id":9498902,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-01-20T08:49:37.185Z","username":"Anna Stoermer"},{"id":639750,"title":null,"review_text":"great","course_id":923384,"rating":5,"user_id":15658070,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-04-24T16:38:17.592Z","username":"glenn tremain"},{"id":694552,"title":null,"review_text":"","course_id":923384,"rating":5,"user_id":6139816,"approved":true,"created_at":"2021-06-21T10:48:04.281Z","username":"ivan62 ."},{"id":704639,"title":null,"review_text":"One Of The Best SEO Course For Beginners.
